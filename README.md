### Summary

Hi everyone, I'm Baraa Nazar and in this video, I will explain the Challenge Project and its components. We have different folders and files, and I will focus on the new arrival component. This component acts as the parent component, containing states and the category button. I will also discuss the card component, which displays item information. Throughout the video, I will demonstrate how I use states, filtering, and mapping. By the end, you will have a clear understanding of the project.

Note: I forgot to mention that the project is responsive.
